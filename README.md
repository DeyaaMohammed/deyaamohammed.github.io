## Learning Journey
I've always been passionate about learning new things. Over the years, I've completed several courses and specializations in manual and automation testing, project management, databases, programming languages (C++ and Java), data structures and algorithms, and more.\
As my learning journey has been a long one, I've created a separate page containing all the information about it. You can find my learning journey [here](https://deyaamohammed.github.io/learningjourney).
